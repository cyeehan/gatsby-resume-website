Wellworthy JavaScript course. Thankfully I came across [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s curated content on [JavaScript Universe](https://justjavascript.com/), learning JavaScript Under the Hood and his mental models really make more sense to me when I look at the codes now.

What more to say? Money well spent ðŸ™‚

The course composed of the things below:

1. Mental Models
2. The JavaScript Universe
3. Values and Variables
4. Studying from the Inside
5. Meeting the Primitive Values
6. Meeting Objects and Functions
7. Equality of Values
8. Properties
9. Mutation
10. Prototypes

He is a great author by the way. Hope in the future, I can be one of the many that people can learn from too.
