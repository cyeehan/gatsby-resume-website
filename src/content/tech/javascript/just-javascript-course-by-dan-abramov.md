Wellworthy JavaScript course. Thankfully I came across [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s curated content on [JavaScript Universe](https://justjavascript.com/), learning his mental models.

Learning or understanding JavaScript **Under the Hood** is certainly amazing! The course composed of the things below:

1. Mental Models
2. The JavaScript Universe
3. Values and Variables
4. Studying from the Inside
5. Meeting the Primitive Values
6. Meeting Objects and Functions
7. Equality of Values
8. Properties
9. Mutation
10. Prototypes

Learning from the best is always eye-opening!

Currently striving and committed to be one of the many that people can learn from!
