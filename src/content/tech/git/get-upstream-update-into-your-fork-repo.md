Once upon a time, I was trying to help a few of my team members to fetch the latest update from the main branch of the remote repository. Then, I figured out it would be best to document it nice and precise for future reference.

```shell
git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME
```

## Let's get started

On your terminal, check your local branches `git branch -l` or all available branches `git branch -a`. 

Now, we have to check out the branch you want to merge to, which is usually your working branch.

```shell
git checkout DESIRED_BRANCH_NAME
```

Now we merge to your current working branch from the upstream repository.

> Note: This approach will not disturb your current commit history.

It's important to specify the command explicitly by doing:

```shell
git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME
```

Now your current working branch is up to date with the original repository, aka the upstream repository.
