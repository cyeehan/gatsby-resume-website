It's based on Linux Shell or "Terminal".

Before started, what Unix-like OS command brings? A good example is that `find *.js` is able to grab all the files end with **.js** in the current directory we are working with.

`ls | grep .js`

Time-saving command that search and list out files end with **.js** which is quite similar to `find`, but with highlighting this time.

Another useful stuff is that viewing file content with syntax highlighting. It is achieved by `brew install bat`.
