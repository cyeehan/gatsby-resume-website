I've seeing how technical people emphasized **Googling** is an extremely important skill that every Software Engineer should properly acquire.

This is not an exhaustive list of **Google Search** techniques, but an opinionated commonly used techniques by myself.

- `filetype:` shows results of a certain filetype (pdf, docx, xlsx, etc.)
- `intitle` find pages that contain a specific word in the title.

## `related:`

Find related sites belonging to **hubspot**? You would get results such as:

- `knowledge.hubspot.com`, `developers.hubspot.com`, etc.

```shell
related:hubspot.com
```

## `site:`

How to center a div? üôà To find all results from stackoverflow.com:

```shell
site:stackoverflow.com how to center a div
```

### `site:[website] ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù`

To search content based on specific keyword on a specific site üò≤

```shell
site:freecodecamp.com "frontend"
```

BUT HOW if medium.com doesn't allow us to search for particular keyword based on **specific tag** or look for **older articles**? I gotchu üò≥

```shell
site:https://medium.com/tag/software-engineering essentials
```

## `"[search term]"`

It's to find exact matches, and they are not based on **keyword** this time.

```shell
"typescript essentials"
```
