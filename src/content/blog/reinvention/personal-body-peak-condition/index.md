## A little context

In September 2017, people especially my friends asked me on the journey of achieving the body shape. Even one of my friends thought I took steroids, but it was merely hard work. Took me 7 months and a lot of sweat and blood.

A little context, the selfie was taken in the gym room of Xiamen University Malaysia early in the morning. I was courageous enough to take off my shirt at that time because no one was around.

## What were the strategies?

No shortcuts.

During my leisure time, I'll be listening to workout advice by [Hany Rambod](https://www.youtube.com/user/EvogenNutrition), and [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffNippard) on YouTube. Jay Cutler, the four-time Mr. Olympia winner was trained by Hany Rambod using the [FST-7 workout routine](https://simplyshredded.com/fst-7-fascia-stretch-training-7-workout-routine-nutrition-guide.html#:~:text=FST%2D7%20is%20a%20training,Hany%20Rambod%2C%20the%20Pro%20Creator.&text=FST%2D7%20is%20a%20training%20system%20I%20devised%20after%20years,exercise%20of%20a%20target%20bodypart.). That's why I followed the FST-7 workout routine closely, and trained as hard as possible.

## What pushed me further?

It was the pressure I put on myself, such as to achieve excellent academic results during my foundation studies in 2017. Obviously, it was not healthy to be living like that, but I have no regrets up until now as I've got nothing to lose. So during that period, I was so committed on mainly two things: **body reinvention** & **academic excellence**.

Also, don't forget the chicken rice. Definitely needed the protein.
