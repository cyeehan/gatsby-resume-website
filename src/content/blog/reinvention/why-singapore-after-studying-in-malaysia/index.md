To be frank, I've been planning to work in Singapore as a **Software Engineer** before I started my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree in Malaysia.

I had no prior programming or coding experience until my **foundation studies** in Xiamen University Malaysia, and I only realised that's what I like to do after completing a course; **Introduction to Computer Science** which is programming.

So what are the 3 things that have been encouraging me to go to Singapore?

1. Career growth and eye-opening opportunities.
2. I prefer their working lifestyle (after observing physically and researching myself).
3. All of my siblings are working in Singapore before me (I'm the youngest in my family).

The reason I put having siblings working in Singapore as the last is that only the **first two** reasons played the crucial roles in dictating my career decisions.

> I went so far started from my small hometown and sought everything I'd strived for which is **acceptance**, **affirmation**, and **respect** from the world.

After graduating in May 2021, kickstart my professional career by taking a leap of faith to join a young and energetic startup company, namely [**Eezee Pte. Ltd.**](https://eezee.sg/) is like having a **risk appetite**, and I embrace all of it.

Look forward to more eye-opening opportunities in Singapore. Learn and explore! 🗺 🧐
