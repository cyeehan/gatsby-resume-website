## Design Patterns

- Code structuring for consistency and readability for engineers.
  - **TypeScript** is a life-saver. It saves time and effort, resulting in more focus time on **features**.
- [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
  - `S`: Single-responsibility Principle. A class/function should have only one job.
  - `O`: Open-closed Principle. Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - `I`: Interface Segregation Principle. No code should be forced to depend on methods it do not use.
  - `D`: Dependency Inversion Principle. High-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

> Juniors developers think of developing features, whereas seniors think of how to remove codes.

## [All the Little Things by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE)

- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.

These two advice striked me so hard at the beginning lol, and I have been constantly reminding myself since.

## Some habits I follow

- Curiosity.
- Breaking down problems into smaller parts.
- Write down what you want to achieve in detail.
- Don't be afraid of copy-paste, but have to understand them.
- Be cautious of hype cycles (skeptical about the latest things came out).
