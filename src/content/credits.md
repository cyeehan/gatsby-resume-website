I started building this site on the 1st day of Chinese New Year 2021, which is on February 11, 2021. At the same time, I was 4,205 km away from my hometown. A little credit to myself for staying safe and not be worried so much by my parents.

## Design

The cool layout of the blog page of this site was inspired by [Gao Wei's dev site](https://aworkinprogress.dev/).

-   Font-family: `Source Sans Pro, Helvatica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
-   Code: `Monaco, Menlo, monospace`
