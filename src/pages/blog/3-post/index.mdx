excerpt: This blog post is because of confusing documentation that made me wasted 30 minutes trying to get everything setup properly such as installation and importing from @material-ui/core/styles vs @material-ui/styles

First step

1. npm install --save gatsby-plugin-material-ui @material-ui/core
 
With the above installation, you can easily import `Material UI v4` libraries and run gatsby locally without any issues that I've faced previously. The code below indicates the API that you would normally import from @material-ui.

```js
import { makeStyles } from "@material-ui/core/styles"
import Paper from "@material-ui/core/Paper"
import Grid from "@material-ui/core/Grid"
```

Wish you happy coding :)
